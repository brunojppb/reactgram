# Reactgram

### An "instagram-like" app created with React

React is the most popular library on the market. Built by Facebook, it is based on functional components which are updated automatically when a state update occurs. Designed around a declarative architecture, components created in React are much easier to build, debug and maintain.  
  
Focused on real world practices, this course will teach you how to build powerful web applications using the most modern tools on the market.  
  
We will build together an **instagram clone for web totally from scratch** where we will post pictures, search for friends, sign-up, sign-in, update profile, follow and unfollow people and much more. During this course we will learn the most important concepts behind React and how to implement them.
